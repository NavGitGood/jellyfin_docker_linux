# jellyfin_docker_linux
setup instructions for jellyfin docker

1. use the docker compose file as is
2. create an empty directory `jellyfin-config` which will store default (autogenerated) configs, as and when created and modified in the jellyfin server (mapped as volume in docker-compose)
3. creare a `media_local` directory, which would be used to store the media that you wish to serve  (mapped as volume in docker-compose)
4. run `docker compose up -d` to start the jellyfin container
5. go to `http://localhost:8096` to check if jellyfin server has started successfully
6. add an admin account
7. after login, add a client account so that other users in same local network can connect to the server
8. add any media in the `media_local` directory, either directly or inside any new subfolder
9. add the media library in jellyfin and verify if all the media is available
10. to connect as a client
    1. get the ip address of the machine where jellyfin server is running by executing `ip -br addr show`, and get the ipv4 for interface starting with either enp (ethernet) or wlp (wireless)
    2. use that address along with the mapped port (8096 in this case) on the client machine to connect
    3. enter the client credentials when prompted


# things to keep in mind
- this is only for local setup, so server and the client(s) should be on the same network 
- jellyfin container can the brought down by running `docker compose down`
- as volume is used for jellyfin configuration, it is persistent and retained even after stopping the container

# troubleshooting
- if docker server is not accessible from host machine `localhost:8096`, run `docker ps` and check if port `8096` is mentioned, if it is not, then port is not accessible (you can also run `netstat -tulpn` to check if port is being used for something else)
